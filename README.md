RMVision Public 0.1 Beta
========

This has not been thoroughly tested with projects outside of our own. There are likely incomplete or broken APIs. Unfortunately, we cannot support any issues you might encounter with this build of RMVision. Because of this, we're making RMVision available fully open-sourced (this version and all future versions).

Pull requests are welcome for bug fixes, but we're not currently accepting new features.
